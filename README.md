ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a Full-Stack Developer specializing in building fully customized, responsive websites and web applications.

I primarily work with TypeScript, focusing on React, Next.js, and NestJS for modern web development. I also create custom WordPress plugins using PHP (though I must admit, I prefer TypeScript for its arrow functions and strict typing. But hey, I like money even more, so I donâ€™t mind getting my hands on some good PHP! Hahaha ðŸ˜„)
